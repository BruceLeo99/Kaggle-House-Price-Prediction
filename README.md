<h1>Intro</h1>

**This Repo contains the code and the result of our participation in an indefinite-period Kaggle Project**🏘️📈

###### Project:

- Goal: Use (advanced) regression algorithm to predict the house price. Train the Regression model on training data, and predict the price of each house in test data.
- Training Data: A set of 1460 house infos from Ames Housing dataset , consisting of 79 features (e.g.: House Area, Number of Neighbours, Built Year, etc.) and 1 _Sale Price_ as the label
- Test Data: A set of 1460 house infos, same features, **Unlabelled** (Labels stored on Kaggle and will be evaluated upon submission).
- Evaluation Metric:  Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
- Competition Time: Indefinite, maximum 10 submissions/day.

###### Our team:

- Team name: Coconut Coffee (Because our idea and journey began from a Café in Amsterdam, with a cup of freshly-made coconut coffee! 🥥)
- Contributors: <a href="https://github.com/BruceLeo99">Yixing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PT-VU">PT</a>
- Rank: 2715
- **Best RMSE score: 0.15644**
